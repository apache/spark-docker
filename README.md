# Apache Spark Official Dockerfiles

## What is Apache Spark?

Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Structured Streaming for stream processing.

## Create a new version 

### Step 1 Add dockerfiles for a new version.

You can see [3.4.0 PR](https://github.com/apache/spark-docker/pull/33) as reference.

- 1.1 Add gpg key to [tools/template.py](https://github.com/apache/spark-docker/blob/master/tools/template.py#L24)

    This gpg key will be used by Dockerfiles (such as [3.4.0](https://github.com/apache/spark-docker/blob/04e85239a8fcc9b3dcfe146bc144ee2b981f8f42/3.4.0/scala2.12-java11-ubuntu/Dockerfile#L41)) to verify the signature of the Apache Spark tarball.

- 1.2 Add image build workflow (such as [3.4.0 yaml](https://github.com/apache/spark-docker/blob/04e85239a8fcc9b3dcfe146bc144ee2b981f8f42/.github/workflows/build_3.4.0.yaml))

    This file will be used by GitHub Actions to build the Docker image when you submit the PR to make sure dockerfiles are correct and pass all tests (build/standalone/kubernetes).

- 1.3 Using `./add-dockerfiles.sh [version]` to add Dockerfiles.

    You will get a new directory with the Dockerfiles for the specified version.

- 1.4 Add version and tag info to versions.json, publish.yml and test.yml.

    This version file will be used by image build workflow (such as [3.4.0](https://github.com/apache/spark-docker/commit/47c357a52625f482b8b0cb831ccb8c9df523affd) reference) and docker official image.

### Step 2. Publish apache/spark Images.

Click [Publish (Java 21 only)](https://github.com/apache/spark-docker/actions/workflows/publish-java21.yaml), [Publish (Java 17 only)](https://github.com/apache/spark-docker/actions/workflows/publish-java17.yaml) (such as 4.x) or [Publish](https://github.com/apache/spark-docker/actions/workflows/publish.yml) (such as 3.x) to publish images.

After this, the [apache/spark](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/spark) docker images will be published.


### Step 3. Publish spark Docker Official Images.

Submit the PR to [docker-library/official-images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/), see (link)[https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/15363] as reference.

You can type `tools/manifest.py manifest` to generate the content.

After this, the [spark](https://hub.docker.com/_/spark) docker images will be published.

We recommend using [Spark Docker Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/spark), the [Apache Spark Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/spark) are provided in case of delays in the review process by Docker community.
